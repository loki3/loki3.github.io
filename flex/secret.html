      The hexaflexagon is a folded paper strip of colored triangles that has long delighted people
      with how it “magically” changes its appearance when “flexed”.
      This hands-on, comprehensive book goes beyond the hexaflexagon, the standard version of this folded puzzle,
      exponentially expanding the barely explored field of flexagons as it brings new options and fresh insights to light.

      “Wow! The possibilities just keep going and going.
      I had no idea there was so much variety in flexagons! Quite an impressive book.
      This book goes into amazing depth in the incredible variety of flexagons.
      There’s something for everyone: if you just want to make cool gadgets,
      there’s clear instructions (and downloadable templates) for a wide variety of shapes,
      but for those who want to go deep, the mathematics of flexagons are also presented, rich and rewarding.
      Be forewarned, though: they’re addictive.”
