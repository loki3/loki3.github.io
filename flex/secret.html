      The hexaflexagon is a folded paper strip of colored triangles that has long delighted people
      with how it “magically” changes its appearance when “flexed”.
      This hands-on, comprehensive book goes beyond the hexaflexagon, the standard version of this folded puzzle,
      exponentially expanding the barely explored field of flexagons as it brings new options and fresh insights to light.
    </p>
    <ul class="no-space">
      <li>Learn over a dozen different flexes, and make dozens of different flexagons with the aid of step-by-step illustrated directions and templates to copy and print.</li>
      <li>Delve into the internal structure of flexagons and discover a universal way to describe and predict their behavior.</li>
      <li>Learn how to create your own custom flexagons with a special computer program.</li>
      <li>Understand how flexagons are connected to group theory, computer science, and topology.</li>
      <li>Have fun decorating flexagons and make flexagon books, puzzles, pop-ups, mazes, and more.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Written in a clear, easy-to-understand, and conversational style and enhanced with challenges and tips
      to broaden your flexagon skills and spark creativity, <i>The Secret World of Flexagons: Fascinating Folded Paper Puzzles</i>
      is a must for flexagon enthusiasts, teachers, students, libraries, mathematicians, and everyone who loves to solve a good puzzle.

      “Wow! The possibilities just keep going and going.
      I had no idea there was so much variety in flexagons! Quite an impressive book.
      This book goes into amazing depth in the incredible variety of flexagons.
      There’s something for everyone: if you just want to make cool gadgets,
      there’s clear instructions (and downloadable templates) for a wide variety of shapes,
      but for those who want to go deep, the mathematics of flexagons are also presented, rich and rewarding.
      Be forewarned, though: they’re addictive.”
